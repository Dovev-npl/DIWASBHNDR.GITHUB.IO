# IT Student

My name is Diwash Bhandari, and I am originally from Sindhupalchok, Nepal. Currently, I live in Kokkola, Finland, at Vidnasinkatu 2 A, where I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology at Centria University of Applied Sciences. Growing up in a supportive family of five, I was inspired to seek higher education abroad to achieve my career aspirations. My journey began in Nepal, where I completed my schooling and started a Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) program before choosing Finland for its practical, hands-on learning approach. In my free time, I enjoy playing football, coding, web design, and listening to lo-fi music, which helps me focus and unwind.
